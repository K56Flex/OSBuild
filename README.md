![icon.png](/Drawable/icon.png)

Ever wanted to peek inside and know more about your device? Well, **OSBuild**, a simple, lightweight, clean and beautiful app, meets your needs. And it works on all phones running Android 2.2 and above!

A simple UI and some nice features make it great tool especially for Android developers and learners.

### Features
* List **RICH RAW** info about the device with keeping most programming words.
* Provide **RICH** related data, like `19  KITKAT  2013-10  39.2%  19`.
* List all features the system supported, such as `FEATURE_USB_HOST`.
* **READ WIFI PASSWORDS**. (**If ROOTED**)
* **OPEN SOURCE**. You can see its source codes on [GitHub](https://github.com/by-syk/OSBuild) to get useful code sections.

### Modules
* Build (`MODEL`, etc.)
* Display (`densityDpi`, etc.)
* Telephony (`deviceId`, etc.)
* CPU (`cpuinfo_max_freq`, etc.)
* Memory (`volumePaths`, etc.)
* Package (`systemAvailableFeatures`, etc.)
* Sensor (`sensorList`, etc.)
* SuperSu
etc.

### Example
There is a slice of data which OSBuild got from my Android phone:
		android.view.Display.
		   getRealSize().
		      x: 1080  360.0dp
		      y: 1920  640.0dp

		   heightPixels: 1920  640.0dp
		   xdpi: 449.704  2.40"
		   ydpi: 447.412  4.29"
		android.content.res.Configuration.
		   screenWidthDp: 360
		   screenHeightDp: 620
		   orientation: 1  ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT
		   fontScale: 1.0
		   screenLayout & 15: 2  SCREENLAYOUT_SIZE_NORMAL  Handset

### Donate
Not financially.
> Just **Share the Page** to me by E-mail. As you can see, only some hardware info about the device (**NO PRIVACY**).
> I'm making the effort to finish my project, DAD (Database of Android Devices). If OSBuild helps a lot, please help me a bit. Thank you.

### Besides...
Meet a new device and want to figure its info out? Install **OSBuild** and **Share the Page**. OK, you've got it.
