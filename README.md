# OSBuild - FOR ANDROID DEVELOPERS

![icon.png](/Other/icon.png)

Ever wanted to peek inside and know more about your device? Well, **OSBuild**, a simple, lightweight, clean and beautiful app, meets your needs. And it works on all phones running Android 2.2 and above!

A simple UI and some nice features make it great tool especially for Android developers and learners.

### Features
* List **RICH RAW** info about the device with keeping most programming words.
* Provide **RICH** related data, like `19  KITKAT  4.4  2013-10  39.3%  19`.
* List all features the system supported, such as `FEATURE_USB_HOST`.
* Expose details of installed apps, including **SIGNATURE**.
* **OPEN SOURCE**. You can see its source codes on [GitHub](https://github.com/by-syk/OSBuild) to get useful code sections.

### Modules
* Primer [the outline for average uses]
* Build [`MODEL`, etc.]
* Display [`densityDpi`, etc.]
* Telephony [`getDeviceId()`, etc.]
* CPU [`cpuinfo_max_freq`, etc.]
* Memory [`getVolumePaths()`, etc.]
* Package [`getSystemAvailableFeatures()`, etc.]
* Sensor [`getSensorList(TYPE_ALL)`, etc.]
* Superuser [`BusyBox`, etc.]
* App [`requestedPermissions`, etc.]
* etc.

### Example
There is a slice of data which **OSBuild"* got from my Android phone:
```
/proc/cpuinfo
   Processor: ARMv7 Processor rev 1 (v7l)
   Hardware: Qualcomm MSM8974PRO-AB
/sys/devices/system/cpu/
   online: 0,2-3  3
   cpu[0-9]/  4
   cpu0/cpufreq/
      cpuinfo_min_freq: 300000  300.00MHz
      cpuinfo_max_freq: 2265600  2.27GHz
      scaling_governor: interactive
javax.microedition.khronos.opengles.GL10.
   glGetString(GL_RENDERER): Adreno (TM) 330
   glGetString(GL_VENDOR): Qualcomm
/sys/class/kgsl/kgsl-3d0/
   max_gpuclk: 578000000  578.00MHz
```

### Raise Your Voice
Any BUGs, mistakes, suggestion or confusion, feedback by E-mail or revise on a market. I would take to heart.

Your voice can make a difference!

### Donate
Not financially.

Just **Share the Page** to me by E-mail or any other available way. As you can see, only some hardware info about the device (**NO PRIVACY**).

Each received file helps me expand the **OSBuild** - **DAD (Database of Android Devices)**.

I've spent plenty of time programming. If you find **OSBuild** useful, please help me a lot. Thank you.

### Besides...
Maybe **OSBuild** could help you with smartphone reviews.
